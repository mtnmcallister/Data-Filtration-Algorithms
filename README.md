# Data-Filtration-Algorithms
Holds 12 algorithms that are compatible with quantopian or a local python instance with quantopian, pyfolio, numpy, and pandas.



See attached files for code used in "Boosting Financial Trading Algorithms Using Data Filtration" 3/18/2020

Code can be copy and pasted into the quantopian algorithm IDE and backtested over any time frames.
To build the algorithms I tested over 01/01/2014-01/01/2015 
and the algorithms were then fully tested and data filtered over 01/01/2016 - 3/17/2020


These algorithms are free to modify and adjust and serve as a good template for running data filtration on other algorithms on the Quantopian platform.

If data filtration is to be actually implemented, the reader would need to build or adjust these algorithms to work on 
another trading platform that allows for algorithmic trading to send in buy and sell signals.

Happy backtesting!
